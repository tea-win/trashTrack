# Inspriration
When we were at UBC, we noticed that people were messing up the trash bins and threw away, for example, banana peel in the recycle bin?
It would damage to equipment and danger to employees in the sorting process. And most importantly, it can cause harm to the environment!

# What it does
Some people just geniuely don't know how to recycle properly so we thought we might want to help them by
scanning what type of waste is compostable for them. If user recycle correctly, we praise them. However, if they do it wrong,
we ROAST them!

# How we built it


# What's next for trashTrack
Currently, it's functioning without the user-interface. We are planning to build a user-interface and train our model to recognize more type of waste
